## Weather App

This weather app uses two APIs and async/await functions. The first, Nominatim, takes the user input and returns the lat/long for their requested location. The second, OpenWeatherMap, takes these values and returns daily, hourly, and current weather data for that location. This data is then rendered, with the option to change from Farenheit to Celcius. The user's last searched location is saved in localStorage and auto-searched when the app is opened.

## Goals for completing this project

1. Gain experience utilizing APIs
2. Practice using async/await functions
3. Continue creating and using modules/webpack.
